# Doggo_2.0

This is my final year project. In this project, we are creating a mobile information system that we will use to connect both dog owners and dog walkers. In most similar existing systems, there are 3 seperate models involved. These are going to be the dog owner system which is only meant to be used by the dog owner, we then have the dog walker with it's own system as well used only by the them and lastly, we have the admin system which is used to communicate we both of the above systems and as well as easier management of them. But, in this system of ours, we plan to integrate both the dog owner and dog walker systems into one, that way, it's easier and faster to use and aswell as easier to manage too because now we have less moving parts in the overall model.
